# CLAUDE.md - Agent Context for Progressive Development

## Current Development Focus

**Active Epic**: Epic 2 - Multi-Timeframe Synchronization Engine ✅ COMPLETE
**Current Story**: Epic 2 Complete - Ready for Epic 3
**Previous Story**: 2.4 - State Persistence ✅ COMPLETE (Merged)
**Development Philosophy**: Build ONLY what current epic needs
**Note**: SQLite chosen over DuckDB in Epic 1 - maintaining this decision

## Critical Boundaries - DO NOT BUILD YET

❌ **Python Integration** - Deferred to Epic 4
❌ **Frontend/Electron** - Deferred to Epic 5
❌ **Position Management** - Deferred to Epic 3
❌ **Charting/Visualization** - Deferred to Epic 5
❌ **Walkback Replay** - Deferred to Epic 6
❌ **Statistical Analysis** - Deferred to Epic 7

## What We Built in Epic 1 (COMPLETE)

✅ **Rust Core Engine** - Basic tick processing
✅ **Simple SQLite** - Basic data storage
✅ **Tick Data Ingestion** - CSV/simple formats
✅ **Basic CLI** - Query interface

## What We Built in Epic 2 (COMPLETE)

✅ **Bar/Candle Data Model** - OHLCV structures (Story 2.0)
✅ **MTF Synchronization** - Multi-timeframe state engine (Story 2.1)
✅ **Indicator Pipeline** - 20 core indicators (Story 2.2)
✅ **Advanced Bar Formation** - Session mgmt, gap handling (Story 2.3)
✅ **State Persistence** - Checkpoint/recovery system (Story 2.4)  

## Current Working Commands

```bash
# These work NOW:
cargo build              # Build Rust workspace
cargo test              # Run tests
cargo clippy            # Lint code
cargo fmt               # Format code
cargo run --bin backtestr -- --help  # CLI help
cargo run --bin backtestr -- import <csv_file>  # Import CSV data
cargo run --bin backtestr -- query --symbol EURUSD  # Query tick data
cargo run --bin backtestr -- stats  # Show database statistics

# These DON'T work yet (don't try):
# npm/pnpm commands     # No frontend yet
# python/pytest         # No Python yet
# electron commands     # No UI yet
```

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding Code

1. **Ask First**: "Is this needed for Epic 1?"
2. **If No**: Add feature flag or defer entirely
3. **If Yes**: Implement minimally, no over-engineering

### Feature Flags

```rust
// Use feature flags for future epic code
#[cfg(feature = "epic_2")]
pub mod advanced_features;

// Current epic code doesn't need flags
pub mod core_features;  // Always built
```

### CI/CD

- Single workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Tests ONLY Rust code
- No Python/Node.js checks until their epics

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Branch naming for Epic 2
git checkout -b story/STORY-2.0-data-model-foundation

# Don't create branches for future epics yet
# ❌ story/STORY-3.1-position-management
# ❌ story/STORY-4.1-python-bridge
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Building Python bridge** - Not until Epic 4
2. **Setting up Electron** - Not until Epic 5
3. **Complex CI workflows** - Keep it simple
4. **Unused dependencies** - Only add what's needed NOW
5. **Empty directories** - Don't create algorithms/, electron/ yet

## Performance Targets

### Epic 1 (Achieved)
- Tick ingestion: 10K ticks/second ✅
- Memory usage: < 500MB for 1M ticks ✅
- Query response: < 100ms for basic queries ✅

### Epic 2 (Current Targets)
- Tick processing: <100μs with all timeframes
- Indicator updates: <50μs for all 20 indicators
- State query: <10μs for snapshot
- Recovery time: <1 second

## Testing Requirements

### Epic 1 Tests
- Unit tests for data structures
- Integration tests for SQLite
- Basic performance benchmarks

### NOT Required Yet
- Python algorithm tests (Epic 4)
- UI component tests (Epic 5)
- Statistical validation (Epic 7)

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before writing ANY code:
1. Is this needed for Epic 2?
2. Will this work without Python/Frontend?
3. Can this be simpler?
4. Am I over-engineering?
5. Does this maintain zero look-ahead bias?
