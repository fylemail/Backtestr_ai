# Epic 2: Story Summary & Implementation Plan

**Epic:** Multi-Timeframe Synchronization Engine
**Total Stories:** 5
**Estimated Duration:** 6-8 weeks
**Status:** Ready to Begin

## Executive Summary

Epic 2 builds the revolutionary MTF (Multi-Timeframe) synchronization engine that is BackTestr's core differentiator. This epic transforms the tick-level infrastructure from Epic 1 into a complete multi-timeframe analysis system with indicators and state persistence.

## Story Dependency Graph

```
Story 2.0 (Data Model Foundation)
    ├── Story 2.1 (MTF State Synchronization)
    │       ├── Story 2.2 (Indicator Pipeline)
    │       └── Story 2.3 (Advanced Bar Formation)
    └───────────► Story 2.4 (State Persistence)
                    (depends on 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
```

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Story 2.0: Data Model Foundation**
- **Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks all other work
- **Duration:** 1-2 weeks
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Bar/Candle data structures
  - Timeframe enumeration
  - Basic tick-to-bar aggregation
  - SQLite schema extension
- **Branch:** `story/STORY-2.0-data-model-foundation`

### Phase 2: Core Engine (Week 3-4)
**Story 2.1: MTF State Synchronization**
- **Priority:** HIGH - Core innovation
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - In-memory MTF state manager
  - Atomic tick processing
  - Partial bar tracking
  - Zero look-ahead bias guarantee
- **Branch:** `story/STORY-2.1-mtf-state-synchronization`

### Phase 3: Parallel Development (Week 5-6)
These can be developed in parallel once 2.1 is complete:

**Story 2.2: Indicator Pipeline**
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Duration:** 1-2 weeks
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - 20 core indicators
  - Incremental calculation
  - Parallel processing with Rayon
- **Branch:** `story/STORY-2.2-indicator-pipeline`

**Story 2.3: Advanced Bar Formation**
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Weekend gap handling
  - Session boundaries
  - Bar completion events
- **Branch:** `story/STORY-2.3-bar-formation-advanced`

### Phase 4: Persistence (Week 7-8)
**Story 2.4: State Persistence**
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - State serialization
  - Checkpoint system
  - Recovery mechanism
- **Branch:** `story/STORY-2.4-state-persistence`

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **SQLite for Everything**
   - Confirmed suitable for backtesting volumes
   - Bars stored alongside ticks
   - In-memory caching for hot paths

2. **Progressive Complexity**
   - Story 2.0 provides basic aggregation
   - Story 2.3 adds advanced features
   - Avoid over-engineering early

3. **Performance First**
   - <100μs tick processing requirement
   - Parallel indicator calculation
   - Memory-efficient with limits

4. **Reliability Focus**
   - Zero look-ahead bias
   - Atomic state updates
   - Checkpoint/recovery system

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **MTF Performance:** Mitigated by in-memory design and caching
2. **Look-ahead Bias:** Extensive testing and temporal ordering
3. **Memory Growth:** Configurable limits and circular buffers

### Process Risks
1. **Story Dependencies:** Clear dependency graph defined
2. **Scope Creep:** Strict story boundaries enforced
3. **Integration Issues:** Progressive integration testing

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Tick Processing: <100μs with all timeframes
- Indicator Updates: <50μs for all 20 indicators
- State Query: <10μs for snapshot
- Recovery Time: <1 second

### Quality Metrics
- Zero look-ahead bias
- >95% test coverage
- All indicators match reference implementations
- Deterministic behavior verified

## Integration Points

### With Epic 1
- Uses SQLite database
- Extends tick model
- Maintains CLI compatibility

### For Future Epics
- Epic 3: Position tracking will use bar data
- Epic 4: Python will access MTF state
- Epic 5: UI will display MTF data
- Epic 6: Replay will use state persistence

## Development Guidelines

1. **Follow Git Strategy**
   - Branch from develop for each story
   - PR reviews required
   - CI must pass before merge

2. **Progressive Development**
   - Build only what's needed
   - No Epic 3+ features
   - Maintain clean interfaces

3. **Documentation**
   - Update story status regularly
   - Document design decisions
   - Keep API docs current

## Definition of Epic Done

- [ ] All 5 stories complete and merged
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Zero look-ahead bias verified
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Epic retrospective conducted

## Next Steps

1. Create `story/STORY-2.0-data-model-foundation` branch
2. Begin Story 2.0 implementation
3. Update CLAUDE.md with active story
4. Set up Epic 2 project board

## Notes for PM

- Story 2.0 is CRITICAL - all other work blocked
- Stories 2.2 and 2.3 can be parallel if resources available
- Consider daily standups during Epic 2
- Monitor performance metrics closely
- Plan Epic 3 during Story 2.4 development
