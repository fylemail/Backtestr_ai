```

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]

**Package Management:**
- Use `pnpm` (recommended) for Node.js packages - symbolic linking improves Windows performance
- Cargo workspace for Rust crates with shared dependencies
- Python 3.11+ embedded interpreter via PyO3

**Build Tools:**
- MSVC toolchain for Windows compilation
- Electron Builder for Windows application packaging
- Windows-specific optimizations in build configuration

**Development Container Setup:**
[Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#windows-development-container-strategy]
- Docker Desktop for Windows with WSL2 backend
- Development container configuration in `.devcontainer/`
- Windows container support for native development
- Volume mounting for hot-reload workflows

### CI/CD Configuration
[Source: architecture/devops-deployment.md#build-pipeline]

The GitHub Actions workflow should include:
- Windows-focused build system (x64 and ARM64 targets)
- Test suite execution across all languages
- Code quality checks (clippy, ESLint, Black)
- Artifact upload for distribution

### Environment Configuration
[Source: architecture/devops-deployment.md]

Environment files should contain:
- Database connection settings
- API endpoints for update server
- Feature flags for development vs production
- Logging and telemetry configuration
- Credential storage preferences

### Coding Standards to Configure
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Rust:**
- rustfmt with default configuration
- clippy with strict warnings
- No `unwrap()` in production code
- 80% test coverage minimum

**TypeScript:**
- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types allowed
- ESLint + Prettier configuration
- React functional components only

**Python:**
- Complete type hints required
- Black formatter configuration
- isort for import organization
- pytest for testing framework

### Testing Strategy Foundation
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

Setup testing infrastructure for:
- Rust: Built-in test framework + criterion for benchmarks
- TypeScript: Jest with React Testing Library
- Python: pytest with PyO3 integration testing
- Integration: Cross-language test harness setup

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-considerations]

- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Input validation at all boundaries
- Regular dependency audits (cargo audit, npm audit)
- Secure defaults for all configurations

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- Rust tests: Within each crate's `src/` directory using `#[cfg(test)]` modules
- Integration tests: `tests/` directory at crate root
- TypeScript tests: Adjacent to components with `.test.tsx` extension
- Python tests: `algorithms/tests/` directory
- E2E tests: `e2e/tests/` directory

### Testing Standards
- All code must pass automated linting before commit
- Minimum 80% unit test coverage for Rust core modules
- Integration tests required for IPC communication
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Use property-based testing for mathematical functions

### Testing Frameworks
- Rust: Built-in test framework, proptest for property testing, criterion for benchmarks
- TypeScript: Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for components
- Python: pytest with hypothesis for property-based testing
- E2E: Playwright for Electron application testing
