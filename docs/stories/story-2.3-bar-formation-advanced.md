    pub fn aggregate_bars(
        &mut self,
        source_bars: &[Bar],
        target_timeframe: Timeframe
    ) -> Option<Bar> {
        let rule = self.aggregation_rules.get(&target_timeframe)?;

        if source_bars.len() < rule.bars_per_aggregation {
            return None;
        }

        // Check session boundary
        if self.session_manager.is_session_boundary(
            target_timeframe,
            source_bars.last()?.timestamp_end
        ) {
            // Force bar completion even if not enough source bars
            return Some(self.create_session_bar(source_bars));
        }

        // Check for gaps
        if self.gap_detector.has_gap(source_bars) {
            // Handle gap appropriately
            return self.handle_gap_aggregation(source_bars);
        }

        // Normal aggregation
        Some(Bar {
            symbol: source_bars[0].symbol.clone(),
            timeframe: target_timeframe,
            timestamp_start: source_bars[0].timestamp_start,
            timestamp_end: source_bars.last()?.timestamp_end,
            open: source_bars[0].open,
            high: source_bars.iter().map(|b| b.high).max_by(f64::total_cmp)?,
            low: source_bars.iter().map(|b| b.low).min_by(f64::total_cmp)?,
            close: source_bars.last()?.close,
            volume: source_bars.iter().map(|b| b.volume.unwrap_or(0)).sum(),
            tick_count: source_bars.iter().map(|b| b.tick_count.unwrap_or(0)).sum(),
        })
    }
}
```
