# Documentation

## Documentation Strategy

BackTestr_ai employs a comprehensive documentation strategy designed to support the complex, multi-language architecture while serving diverse stakeholder needs from developers to end-users. The documentation strategy emphasizes living documentation that evolves with the codebase, automated generation where possible, and clear separation of concerns across different documentation types.

The documentation ecosystem is structured to minimize maintenance overhead while maximizing usability, with particular attention to the financial domain's requirements for precision, compliance, and auditability.
