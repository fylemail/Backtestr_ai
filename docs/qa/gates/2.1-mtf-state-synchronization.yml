final_assessment: |
  Story 2.1 demonstrates exceptional engineering quality. The MTF state synchronization
  engine is well-architected, thoroughly tested, and performant. The implementation
  successfully addresses the core differentiator requirement with proper temporal
  ordering and zero look-ahead bias prevention through careful timestamp management.

  The use of RwLock for thread-safety, configurable resource limits, and comprehensive
  error handling shows mature engineering practices. All 37 tests pass, and the code
  is clean with no linting issues.

  QUALITY SCORE: 95/100

  The story is ready for production use with minor recommendations for future
  enhancement around observability and monitoring.
