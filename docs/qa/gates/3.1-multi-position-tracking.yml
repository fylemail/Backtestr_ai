architecture_assessment:
  strengths:
    - 'Thread-safe design using DashMap for lock-free concurrent access'
    - 'Efficient indexing strategy with O(1) lookups'
    - 'Clean separation between position lifecycle, P&L calculation, and persistence'
    - 'Proper integration with Epic 2 interfaces without breaking changes'
    - 'Comprehensive parent-child relationship support'
  areas_for_improvement:
    - 'Duplicate code in stop loss/take profit handling could be refactored'
    - 'Consider extracting trade event logging to separate concern'
    - 'Position validation logic could be centralized'
