decision_rationale: |
  Story 1.2 successfully implements basic DuckDB integration following progressive 
  development principles. All critical acceptance criteria are met. Minor gaps 
  (retry logic) are properly deferred and documented. The implementation is clean,
  well-tested, and maintains appropriate boundaries for Epic 1. The foundation
  is solid for future enhancement in subsequent epics.

next_steps:
  - "Code review by team"
  - "Merge to develop branch"
  - "Begin Story 1.3 (Simple CSV Import)"
