notes: |
  Exceptional implementation of advanced bar formation with sophisticated features:
  - Multi-timeframe aggregation with proper cascade
  - Comprehensive session and market hours management
  - Robust gap detection and handling
  - Volume aggregation with VWAP and profile calculations
  - Event-driven architecture with guaranteed ordering

  The code demonstrates excellent Rust practices and meets all performance targets.
  Minor style improvements suggested are non-blocking and can be addressed in future iterations.
