# Feature Preservation Matrix
*Generated to track feature redistribution during progressive development restructuring*

## Overview
This matrix ensures all features from the original Epic 1 definition are preserved and properly sequenced across epics following progressive development principles.

### Epic 7: Statistical Analysis
*Features to be defined when epic is activated*

## Validation Checklist

### ✅ No Features Lost
- All 9 original stories mapped to appropriate epics
- All sub-features tracked and assigned
- Clear ownership for each feature

### ✅ Progressive Dependencies Maintained
- Epic 1: Pure Rust, no external dependencies
- Epic 2: Builds on Epic 1 data layer
- Epic 3: Requires Epic 2 data pipeline
- Epic 4: Requires Epic 3 state engine
- Epic 5: Requires Epic 4 for full integration
- Epic 6-7: Require Epic 5 for visualization

### ✅ Technical Boundaries Respected
- No Python in Epic 1-2
- No Frontend in Epic 1-4
- No IPC in Epic 1-4
- No MTF in Epic 1-2
- No complex credentials in Epic 1

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **DuckDB compatibility issue** - Currently blocking Story 1.2
2. **Scope creep** - Temptation to add "just one more feature"
3. **Documentation drift** - Multiple docs with conflicting information

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Resolve DuckDB arrow-arith conflict before starting Story 1.2
2. Strict adherence to CLAUDE.md boundaries
3. Single source of truth: CLAUDE.md + this matrix

## Success Metrics

### Epic 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] 5 stories or fewer
- [ ] Pure Rust implementation
- [ ] 10K ticks/second import
- [ ] <500MB memory for 1M ticks
- [ ] <100ms query response
- [ ] No external language dependencies

### Overall Success Criteria
- [ ] All original features preserved
- [ ] Clear epic boundaries maintained
- [ ] Progressive build-up achieved
- [ ] No architectural debt introduced

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Create simplified Story 1.2-1.5 documents
2. **Short-term**: Update Epic 1 main document
3. **Medium-term**: Create Epic 2-5 story placeholders
4. **Long-term**: Review after each epic completion
