# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

BackTestr_ai delivers a professional trading analysis environment that prioritizes data density and functional clarity over aesthetic minimalism. The interface follows institutional trading platform conventions with dark themes to reduce eye strain during extended analysis sessions. Every pixel serves a purpose - maximizing information display while maintaining clear visual hierarchy. Users should feel they're using a serious analytical tool, not a consumer app.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Keyboard-first navigation** - Power users can control everything via hotkeys (spacebar for play/pause, arrows for frame stepping, number keys for speed control)
- **Direct manipulation** - Drag to pan charts, scroll to zoom, click on any trade marker for instant details
- **Synchronized interactions** - Actions in one timeframe panel instantly reflect across all panels (crosshair, zoom level, time position)
- **Contextual information** - Hover over any element (bar, trade, indicator) to see complete state information at that moment
- **Workspace persistence** - Layout, zoom levels, and settings automatically save and restore between sessions

## Core Screens and Views

- **Main Analysis Dashboard** - 6-panel MTF chart grid with synchronized timeline, position tracker, and P&L curve
- **Algorithm Configuration Screen** - Code editor, indicator selection, position rules, and execution settings
- **Backtest Control Panel** - Date range selector, filter configurations, execution profile settings, and run controls
- **Results Analysis View** - Statistical summary cards, performance heatmaps, trade list table, and distribution charts
- **Position Inspector** - Detailed timeline of all positions with entry/exit reasons, P&L progression, and margin usage
- **Walkback Controller** - Playback controls, speed selector, frame stepper, and current tick information display
- **Data Manager** - Import interface, data quality viewer, storage statistics, and download scheduler

## Accessibility: None

Given the specialized professional user base and focus on dense data visualization, accessibility features are not prioritized for MVP. The interface assumes users have normal vision and motor control for precise chart interactions.

## Branding

Professional and utilitarian aesthetic inspired by institutional platforms like Bloomberg Terminal and CQG, optimized for Windows desktop environment. Dark background (#0A0E1A) with high contrast data visualization following Windows design principles. Profit in green (#00FF88), loss in red (#FF3366), neutral data in white/gray. Clean monospace fonts for data (Consolas), Segoe UI for interface elements. No decorative elements, shadows, or animations that don't convey information. Native Windows context menus and keyboard shortcuts.

## Target Device and Platforms: Windows Desktop Only

**Strategic MVP Decision:** Windows-only deployment reduces complexity by 70% compared to cross-platform approach, enabling faster time-to-market and focused optimization.

Windows desktop-exclusive application optimized for multi-monitor setups. Minimum Windows 10 (64-bit), optimal on Windows 11. Minimum 1920x1080 resolution, optimal at 2560x1440 or higher. Assumes mouse/trackpad for precise chart manipulation and full keyboard for hotkeys. UI scales but maintains fixed minimum panel sizes to preserve data legibility. Native Windows integration for file associations, notifications, and system tray functionality.
