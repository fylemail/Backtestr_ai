# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Data Pipeline (Progressive)

**Goal:** Establish a minimal, working foundation using progressive development principles. Focus on Rust core engine and basic data pipeline only. No Python, no frontend, no advanced features.

**Progressive Development Context:** This epic has been restructured following CLAUDE.md principles. Only includes what's absolutely necessary for a working foundation. Advanced features are properly deferred to later epics.

## Epic Overview

### What We're Building
- ‚úÖ Rust workspace structure
- ‚úÖ Basic DuckDB integration  
- ‚úÖ Simple CSV import
- ‚úÖ Basic CLI for queries
- ‚úÖ Performance validation

### What We're NOT Building (Deferred)
- ‚ùå Python integration ‚Üí Epic 4
- ‚ùå Frontend/Electron ‚Üí Epic 5
- ‚ùå IPC architecture ‚Üí Epic 5
- ‚ùå Advanced credentials ‚Üí Epic 2
- ‚ùå MTF state engine ‚Üí Epic 3
- ‚ùå Service architecture ‚Üí Epic 3
- ‚ùå Complex optimizations ‚Üí Epic 2

## Stories

## Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**As a** developer,  
**I want** a Rust-focused monorepo with basic tooling,  
**So that** I can build the core engine without complexity.

### Acceptance Criteria (COMPLETED)
1. ‚úÖ Rust workspace structure created (crates/)
2. ‚úÖ Cargo workspace configured with shared dependencies
3. ‚úÖ Basic environment configuration (.env support)
4. ‚úÖ Simple CI/CD pipeline (Rust only)
5. ‚úÖ Git repository with proper .gitignore
6. ‚úÖ Development scripts (cargo build, test, clippy)
7. ‚úÖ README.md with setup instructions
8. ‚úÖ Rust toolchain installed and working

**Status:** Merged to develop (commit f5d28a6)

## Story 1.2: Basic DuckDB Integration üìù NEXT

**As a** developer,  
**I want** basic DuckDB embedded database integration,  
**So that** I can store and query tick data locally.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] Resolve DuckDB arrow-arith compatibility issue
2. [ ] Add DuckDB dependency to workspace
3. [ ] Create simple tick table schema (symbol, timestamp, bid, ask)
4. [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations
5. [ ] Support in-memory and file-based databases
6. [ ] Add unit and integration tests

### Technical Details
- Use `duckdb = { version = "0.9", features = ["bundled"] }`
- Simple schema only - no partitioning or optimization
- Basic connection management - no pooling needed yet

**Dependencies:** Story 1.1  
**Branch:** `story/STORY-1.2-basic-duckdb-integration`

---

## Story 1.3: Simple CSV Tick Import üìù PLANNED

**As a** developer,  
**I want** basic CSV import functionality,  
**So that** I can load historical tick data.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] Parse standard CSV format (symbol, timestamp, bid, ask)
2. [ ] Validate required fields present
3. [ ] Batch insert into DuckDB (1000 rows/batch)
4. [ ] Handle invalid rows with error logging
5. [ ] Return import summary (processed, errors, inserted)
6. [ ] Create sample test data files

### Technical Details
- Support CSV files up to 100MB
- Basic validation only
- No progress reporting or streaming

**Dependencies:** Story 1.2  
**Branch:** `story/STORY-1.3-simple-csv-import`

---

## Story 1.4: Basic CLI Query Interface üìù PLANNED

**As a** user,  
**I want** a simple command-line interface,  
**So that** I can import and query tick data.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] Create `backtestr` CLI binary
2. [ ] Implement `import` command for CSV files
3. [ ] Implement `query` command with symbol/date filters
4. [ ] Implement `stats` command for database overview
5. [ ] Implement `delete` command for data cleanup
6. [ ] Add table, CSV, and JSON output formats

### Commands
```bash
backtestr import --file data.csv
backtestr query --symbol EURUSD --from 2024-01-01 --to 2024-01-02
backtestr stats
backtestr delete --symbol EURUSD --confirm
```

**Dependencies:** Story 1.3  
**Branch:** `story/STORY-1.4-basic-cli-queries`

---

## Story 1.5: Basic Performance Validation üìù PLANNED

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to validate basic performance targets,  
**So that** I know the foundation is solid.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. [ ] Create Criterion benchmark suite
2. [ ] Validate tick insertion: ‚â•10K ticks/second
3. [ ] Validate memory usage: <500MB for 1M ticks
4. [ ] Validate query response: <100ms for basic queries
5. [ ] Document performance baseline
6. [ ] Identify optimization opportunities for Epic 2

### Technical Details
- Use Criterion.rs for benchmarking
- Basic profiling only
- Document but don't optimize unless targets missed

**Dependencies:** Story 1.4  
**Branch:** `story/STORY-1.5-performance-validation`

---

## Epic Completion Criteria

### Must Have
- [x] Rust workspace building and tested
- [ ] DuckDB storing and querying ticks
- [ ] CSV import working
- [ ] CLI providing basic access
- [ ] Performance targets met

### Nice to Have (But Not Required)
- [ ] Better error messages
- [ ] More CSV formats
- [ ] Additional CLI commands

### Explicitly Excluded
- No Python code
- No JavaScript/TypeScript
- No IPC/messaging
- No complex schemas
- No optimization beyond basics
- No real-time data
- No MTF processing
- No service architecture

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Tick insertion | ‚â•10K/second | Required |
| Memory (1M ticks) | <500MB | Required |
| Query response | <100ms | Required |
| CSV import | >10K rows/second | Nice to have |

## Risk Mitigation

### Known Issues
1. **DuckDB compatibility** - Arrow-arith version conflict needs resolution
2. **Scope creep** - Strong temptation to add "just one more feature"
3. **Documentation drift** - Multiple docs with conflicting information

### Mitigation Strategy
1. Fix DuckDB issue before starting Story 1.2
2. Strict adherence to acceptance criteria
3. CLAUDE.md as single source of truth

## Success Metrics

### Epic Success
- [ ] All 5 stories complete
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Zero dependencies on future epics
- [ ] Clean, maintainable codebase
- [ ] Clear path to Epic 2

### Warning Signs
- Adding Python "just for testing"
- Creating IPC "for future use"
- Complex optimization attempts
- Feature additions beyond scope

## Notes for Developers

### Do's
- Keep it simple
- Focus on correctness
- Test thoroughly
- Document clearly
- Ask when unsure

### Don'ts
- Don't add Python
- Don't add frontend code
- Don't over-engineer
- Don't optimize prematurely
- Don't add unused features
