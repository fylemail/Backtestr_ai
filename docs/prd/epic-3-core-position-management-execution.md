# Epic 3: Core Position Management & Execution

**Goal:** Implement comprehensive multi-position tracking with realistic execution modeling, enabling complex strategies like pyramiding and grid trading while maintaining performance.

## Story 3.1: Multi-Position Tracking System

**As a** trader,  
**I want** support for unlimited concurrent positions,  
**so that** I can run grid, pyramiding, and hedging strategies.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Position manager tracks unlimited positions per symbol
2: Each position has unique ID and independent parameters
3: O(1) position lookup by ID for performance
4: Position hierarchy supports parent-child relationships
5: Aggregate exposure calculated across all positions
6: Memory efficient even with 100+ positions
7: Position state changes logged for debugging
8: Basic console output shows all open positions

## Story 3.2: Order Execution Engine

**As a** trader,  
**I want** realistic order execution with configurable slippage,  
**so that** my backtests accurately reflect real trading conditions.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Three execution models implemented (Perfect, Realistic, Worst-case)
2: Slippage applied based on tick bid-ask spread
3: Position entry/exit at correct prices (ask for buy, bid for sell)
4: Stop loss and take profit orders execute at exact levels
5: Trailing stops update and trigger correctly
6: Partial fills simulated in worst-case mode
7: Commission and swap costs calculated
8: Execution logs show price, slippage, and costs

## Story 3.3: Risk Management System

**As a** trader,  
**I want** comprehensive risk management,  
**so that** positions are protected and exposure is controlled.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Stop loss orders execute immediately when price touched
2: Take profit orders fill at exact levels
3: Trailing stops adjust based on favorable price movement
4: Margin calls triggered when equity insufficient
5: Maximum position limits enforced per symbol
6: Aggregate risk metrics calculated (VaR, max drawdown potential)
7: Position sizing functions available (fixed, percentage, Kelly)
8: Risk events logged with timestamps and reasons

## Story 3.4: Trade Lifecycle Logging

**As a** developer,  
**I want** detailed trade logging,  
**so that** I can verify execution without visualization.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Every position open logged with entry details
2: Position updates logged each tick (P&L, MAE, MFE)
3: Position close logged with exit reason and final P&L
4: Summary statistics printed after backtest completes
5: Logs include timestamps, prices, and position IDs
6: Configurable log levels (verbose, normal, quiet)
7: Performance impact of logging <5% overhead
8: Logs parseable for automated analysis
