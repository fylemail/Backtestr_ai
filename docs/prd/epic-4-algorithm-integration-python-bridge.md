# Epic 4: Algorithm Integration & Python Bridge

**Goal:** Enable Python-based algorithm development with seamless integration to the Rust engine, providing traders familiar syntax with high performance.

## Story 4.1: PyO3 Integration Layer

**As a** developer,  
**I want** Python embedded in Rust via PyO3,  
**so that** algorithms can be written in Python with minimal performance impact.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: PyO3 integrated with proper Python 3.11+ initialization
2: Python interpreter embedded without GIL conflicts
3: Data structures efficiently shared between Rust and Python
4: NumPy arrays zero-copy accessible from Rust
5: Error handling propagates Python exceptions properly
6: Performance overhead <10% vs pure Rust
7: Python package dependencies installable (pandas, numpy, talib)
8: Development reload without recompiling Rust

## Story 4.2: Algorithm Interface Implementation

**As a** trader,  
**I want** a clean Python API for writing algorithms,  
**so that** I can focus on strategy logic not infrastructure.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Base Algorithm class with initialize() and on_tick() methods
2: Access to MTF state from Python without serialization overhead
3: Position management methods (open, close, modify)
4: Indicator registration and access simplified
5: Algorithm state persisted between ticks
6: Custom logging methods available
7: Example algorithms provided (SMA cross, RSI oversold)
8: Documentation with code completion support

## Story 4.3: Custom Indicator Support

**As a** trader,  
**I want** to create custom indicators in Python,  
**so that** I can implement proprietary analysis.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Custom indicator base class with calculate() method
2: Access to price history arrays for calculations
3: Indicator values cached automatically
4: Support for multi-timeframe indicators
5: TA-Lib integration for standard indicators
6: Performance monitoring to identify slow indicators
7: Incremental calculation support for efficiency
8: Examples of complex indicators (Market Structure, Order Blocks)

## Story 4.4: Algorithm Validation and Testing

**As a** developer,  
**I want** algorithm validation tools,  
**so that** I can test strategies before running full backtests.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Syntax validation before execution
2: Dry run mode with sample data
3: Performance profiling per algorithm function
4: Memory leak detection for Python objects
5: Unit test framework for algorithm components
6: Mock data generators for testing edge cases
7: Algorithm metrics (complexity, indicator count, position frequency)
8: Debug mode with breakpoint support
