# BackTestr_ai

## Revolutionary Multi-Timeframe Forex Backtesting Platform

BackTestr_ai solves the critical validation gap in algorithmic trading where existing platforms fail at multi-timeframe strategy testing. Our MTF (Multi-Timeframe) State Engine maintains synchronized partial and completed bar states across all timeframes at every tick, achieving 95%+ correlation between backtest and live trading results.

## Project Status

- **Documentation**: âœ… Complete (PRD & Architecture validated at 95% readiness)
- **Development**: ðŸš€ Ready to begin Epic 1
- **Method**: BMad Method with multi-agent orchestration

## Technology Stack

- **Core Engine**: Rust (high-performance tick processing)
- **Algorithm Runtime**: Python via PyO3 bridge
- **Data Storage**: DuckDB (columnar storage with 10-20x compression)
- **UI Framework**: Electron + React + TypeScript
- **Charts**: Lightweight Charts (TradingView library)
- **Target Platform**: Windows Desktop (MVP)

## Key Features

- Process 1M+ ticks per second with sub-100Î¼s MTF state updates
- 6-panel synchronized chart visualization
- Tick-by-tick walkback replay with variable speed control
- Comprehensive statistical analysis and performance heatmaps
- Multi-position tracking with realistic execution modeling

## Development Approach

This project uses the BMad Method for AI-driven development with comprehensive documentation-first approach:

- `/docs/prd/` - Product Requirements (sharded)
- `/docs/architecture/` - System Architecture (sharded)
- `/.bmad-core/` - BMad framework and agents
- `/.ignore/` - Original documentation files

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Rust toolchain (latest stable)
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.11+
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fylemail/Backtestr_ai.git
cd Backtestr_ai

# Install dependencies (coming in Epic 1)
# cargo build
# npm install
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```
